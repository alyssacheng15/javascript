        <h1>Observations</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>As I clicked a button, many request statuses turned to "200," meaning the server responded with an "OK" and it is successful.</li>
            <li>When I scroll down the page, many new requests come up.</li>
            <li>There is a green and red graph on the top that displays the time it takes for the requests to load (in ms).</li>
        </ul>
